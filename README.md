# Blood-Donation-Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a donor is likely to donate blood in the future based on historical donation data. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment-ready code‚Äîall implemented in a Jupyter notebook using Python and popular ML libraries.

üîç Key Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature selection and normalization

Model building using classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Accuracy evaluation and confusion matrix

Easy-to-follow and fully commented code in Google Colab format
